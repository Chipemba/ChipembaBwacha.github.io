									&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Cimate Change is an ongoing issue that is affecting the planet as a whole, with its effects being more evident in more places than others. This project focuses on the effect Climate Change has had on six South-Eastern African countries (Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia). The project will compromise of three parts ; Rainfall, Crops, Consumption & Population. 
								</p>
								<p>	
									&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Rainfall project focuses on the exploration of rainfall data received by each of the countries between the years of 1998 and 2018. The original rainfall data used in this project was collect from the  <a target="blank" href="https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data">Client Knowledge Portal</a>

									<h3>Questions & Hypothesis</h3>
									</header>
									<p>1. Has there been a change to the amount of rainfall received?<br/>
									&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Hypothesis</span>:  Yes, climate change has reduced the amount of rainfall.</p>

									<p>2. How has the rainfall pattern been affected by climate change?<br/>
									&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Hypothesis</span>: The months in which rainfall is expected heaviest have reduced.</p>

											1. Has there been a change to the amount of rainfall received?
										</span>

										<div id="graph">
											<p >
												&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;When visualised the total yearly rainfall data allows for many inferences to be made. One of which can be that the amount of rainfall received did change but unlike my above stated hypothesis did not increase across all countries. Malawi, Uganda and Kenya were the three with a notable increase change in the amount of rainfall received per year. Zambia and Tanzania maintained a somewhat level amount of rainfall received. Mozambique was the only country to show a slight decrease in the amount of rainfall received. Another observation that can be made is that all the selected countries did not have a consistent amount of rainfall received across the years.

										<p>
											&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A lack of consistency was observed when looking at the amount of rainfall received. However, the inconsistency shown was somewhat consistent itself during the 20 year period analysed. All the countries showed somewhat of a uniform inconsistency to the amount of rainfall received year by year with exception to a few years. This lead to the analysis of the seasonal rainfall totals.
										</p>
									</div>
								</section>
										<p>
											&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A visualisation of the data showed that indeed as stated in the hypothesis the pattern has been affected, in that the rainfall received during the rainy seasons has reduced. This was especially seen in the case of Uganda which had some of the highest in yearly rainfall totals but was found to be among the lowest in the seasonal totals.

										<p>
											&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Zambia, Malawi and Mozambique each have the same months as their rainy seasons. This allowed for an analysation with fewer differences in variables as to whether the amount of rainfall received or the pattern has been affected by climate change. A conclusion that both the quantity of rainfall and the pattern has been slightly affected affected (atleast for these countries). After comparing one year every five years the quantity change was shown when a different country had the highest seasonal rainfall.

										<h3>Challenges</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										1.&emsp;Research on which months made up the rainy seasons of the countries varied depending on the source. This initially was of no consequence but later showed that a wrongly chosen source would skew the analysis..
									</p>
									<p>
										2.&emsp;The Disaster dataset that was to be used in conjunction with the rainfall datasets was missing data that rendered the dataset unusable this time around..
									</p>

									<header class="major">
										<h3>Recommendations</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To get a clearer understanding of the impact climate change has had, an additional analysis of natural disasters would be beneficial. Information on whether the occurrence of disasters has changed (increased or reduced) or if there has been a change in the types of natural disasters. This would assist in giving a clearer picture on the effect of Climate Change as an overlay of when natural disasters occurred with the already acquired rainfall data would show what type of effect the disaster had.
									</p>
									<p>
										&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Research on when the rainy seasons of the countries take place coupled with the actual rainfall data would lead to less skewed analysis. However, one has to be careful not to represent the effects of climate change (reduction or increase in rainfall) as the rainy seasons or otherwise.
